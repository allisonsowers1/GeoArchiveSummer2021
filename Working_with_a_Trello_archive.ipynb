As part of our overall effort to explore open science practices, this record of what we did as part of the project is important to share. We will archive a final export from Trello in our [OSF workspace](https://osf.io/t6azp/) as part of making even this somewhat mundane aspect of running a project open and transparent. There might be useful information in the record of our tasks for others to build upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "With its free version, Trello provides an export of a given board as a JSON document. This is available via a URL for board members who are logged in. There are also ways of interfacing programmatically with Trello via an API that could provide other means of getting at the information, and there's even a [Python project](https://pypi.org/project/py-trello/) for working with Trello that could be useful. For our purposes, any interface to what we have in Trello after the project is concluded will be via the archive we save out to OSF. So, we focus our attention here on working with that file.\n",

        "When our OSF project is made public, we should be able to provide a way for this notebook to call up the export JSON file from the OSF files container programmatically via a web request.

There are a number of standards that inform how metadata need to be structured. The vast majority of USGS metadata follows a standard called FGDC CSDGM, which stands for the Federal Geospatial Data Committee's Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata. This is an older standard that is slowly being phased out in favor of something that works better with modern tech, but most of our scientists still use this standard. You can read all about the standard if you want, but it would be most helpful to focus in on a specific example. I posted a note about this in Slack, but I also wanted to assign some work to simply read over one very detailed example that we can talk about further. Here is a link to a web page representation of an FGDC CSDGM metadata document for a dataset from one of the geochemistry labs we'll be working with.\\n\\nhttps://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/601963c6d34edf5c66f0d0e5?f=__disk__f2%2F3d%2Fa3%2Ff23da3810779475691a06cafb57cd4906236355c&transform=1&allowOpen=true\",\n",
