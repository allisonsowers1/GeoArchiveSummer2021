# GeoArchiveSummer2021
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that work through a couple aspects of a summer internship project through the UNAVCO GeoLaunchpad program. It was set up as an exercise for the open science practice of sharing code and workflows to improve transparency and reproducibility. The internship project is centered around open science and the importance of documenting and publishing scientific protocols. Our internship focused on a GeoArchive project where we are formally documenting an information management protocol for dealing with data extraction from NI 43-101 reports and the archival process for these reports. We are using several open science methods to document the protocols created and data processing methods used as a living example for other groups across the USGS and in other organizations. Through open science practices we can accelerate scientific practice and improve trustworthiness in our results.
