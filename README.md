# GeoArchiveSummer2021
# This repository has been created to provide transparency and openness for our summer internship program, it shows every task assigned through our Trello board. The project is centered around open science and the importance of documenting and publishing scientific protocols. Our internship focused on a GeoArchive project where we are formally documenting an information management protocol for dealing with data extraction from NI 43-101 reports and the archival process for these reports. We are using several open science methods to document the protocols created and data processing methods used as a living example for other groups across the USGS and in other organizations. Through open science practices we can accelerate scientific practice and improve trustworthiness in our results.
